I have been a hobby photographer for about a year now. I have enjoyed the experience so far. Photography motivates me to explore and look at the world from different perspectives. Finding compositions is a great creative exercise.

I was also impressed with the amount of learning material that is available on platforms like YouTube. I reminded me how privileged we are when it comes down to access to knowledge. Previous generations had mostly figure things out for themselves or had to be lucky enough to study under someone with more experience.

I watched many videos where professional photographers explained the technical ins and outs of photography equipment and shared their knowledge about topics such as composition. One of the topics that often came up was “Shooting for the edit” followed by terms like “Exposing to the right” (ETTR).

The idea was to optimize the amount of information which the image sensor of the camera collects. The resulting image could then be imported in an editing suite such as Adobe Photoshop or Lightroom. This is where the photographer could express their creative vision and edit the image to their liking.

Although I don’t have the ambition to turn my hobby into a job, I do want to improve and get better. So I did what the pros told me to do and started shooting my photos with post-processing in mind. At first I thought that I was making progress, but then I noticed that my attitude had changed. I became sloppy and less passionate when photographing. It felt like I was simply recording a scene rather than photographing it.

Many photography related videos show you before and after photos. These are supposed to show you how much an image can be improved with editing. I therefore find it quite ironic when I find myself liking the unedited photo more than the edited one. The unedited photo feels real while the edited one depicts a scene that feels “out of this world”. Like it was not taken on this planet, but in another realm.

I have come to call these edited photos “Narnia Shots”, since they look like they were taken in the magical kingdom of Narnia. And although you might be blown away by these images at first sight, they start feeling “wrong” as you study them for a longer period. I would pause the video when the images were shown and stare at them for a while.

It is difficult to make an edited image look natural. The biggest giveaways to me are the wrong use of (especially) bright colors and addition or exaggeration of light sources. It all essentially comes down to light. Photographers seem to want to make their photos look like they were shot during the golden hour even though they didn’t take to photo at this time.

The golden hour is the hour before the sun disappears behind the horizon. This time of day produces the best lighting conditions for photography.

I decided that this was not the photographic style I wanted to pursue, and devised a new strategy for my future development. The first thing I did was to acquire a smaller Every Day Camera. This is a smaller and lighter camera that you can take every where with you. I love taking photos with my Nikon Z5, but it’s one heavy brick. Not something you can just throw into a bag.

I researched different lightweight setups and eventually bought a secondhand Nikon Z50, which can be seen as the smaller brother of the Nikon Z5. I was actually excited about a buying the Olympus E-M5 at first, but I didn’t want to spend the time on learning a different camera system. I wanted something familiar, so I could focus on things like composition instead.

The Z50 was a good fit in this regard. It operated in the same way as my Z5. A lot of the controls were at the same location and the menu system was the same. The only thing I had to get used to were the proper aperture settings. A smaller and lighter camera was successful in motivating me to go out and shoot more, but it wasn’t enough.

One problem I had with the “Shoot for the edit” mentality was that it made my shooting experience feel sterile. It felt like I was just operating a piece of machinery instead of being creative. Set your aperture right, look at the little diagram, make sure to not clip your highlights or shadows, and press the shutter release button. And then I was supposed to release my creativity behind a computer screen when I go back home.

I am not saying that this would work for others, but it was surely not working for me. I therefore decided to leave this way of working behind me. I started shooting solely in JPEG instead of JPEG and RAW. Shooting in JPEG kept me sharp, since there is less room for mistakes. It forces you to pay more attention to things like exposure and white balance.

I also started to be more creative with my exposure, sometimes even clipping my highlights or shadows. There is just something about making the decision in the moment, not later behind a screen. I still edit my photos, but the process is quicker. I try to get everything right in camera and the JPEGs are already pre-edited. I only need to apply the finishing touches.

After applying all of these changes to my way of photography, I can gladly say that my love for photography is stronger than ever. I love taking photos during my evening walk, and they are mostly not even good ones. It reminds me of the time when I was just a kid walking around with his point-and-shoot camera, taking pictures of the things that I found interesting.

My advise to beginner photographers, from someone who is still a beginner himself, would be to focus on getting to know their camera, creating the right habits, and compositions instead of diving right into image editing. The Pro’s on YouTube might tell you that you have to shoot RAW and edit your photos (and buy their presets), but there is nothing wrong with shooting in JPEG.

Once to have the basics down, developed the right habits and maybe even started developing your own style, you can go ahead and shoot in RAW if you want too. I however think that the JPEGs coming out of my Z5 and Z50 are quick alright. I do recommend setting the Picture Control profile to either Standard or Neutral.

The Neutral profile applies the minimal amount of changes to the JPEG as is meant to serve as a basis for editing. I have also assign the “+RAW” function to my record button. This red button does nothing by default when the camera is photo mode. The button now functions as a RAW toggle. This allows me quickly set the camera up capture the photo in JPEG as well as RAW. I refer to it as my “safety net button”.

And whenever you want to make fancy Narnia shots or want to take photo’s which are closer to reality is really up to you. They are your photo’s after all. I do prefer more true-to-life photos myself even if these don’t have the wow effect as the Narnia shots have. I might switch back to shooting JPEG+RAW after having all the good habits down.

The only problem I have is that Apple Photos doesn’t have a “delete RAW” option for JPEG+RAW image pairs. You can only have the option to delete the whole image. There is a method where you export the original JPEG and RAW file, delete the image, remove the image from the trashbin, and only re-import the JPEG file.

It would be nice to be able to delete the RAW files of the photos that I want to keep, but have no interest in editing. But hey, maybe an Apple Engineer will read this post and the feature gets implemented in the future (probably not going to happen).

Well, this was all I wanted to write about. I hope this post gave you a different perspective from someone who is just staring out.
